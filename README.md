# Wedding website with Vue
I made a last minute wedding website while trying to learn the basics of Vue.js. Created my first single page application. It wasn't too bad for someone who doesn't work with JS frameworks regularly.


# Default starter for Gridsome

This is the project you get when you run `gridsome create new-project`.

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site` to install default starter
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open the folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ
