    <h1>How it all began</h1>

    <h2></h2>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>Michael and Berlin met in the Spring of 2013. Berlin was an uninvited designated driver at a party
     that Michael's house mate was hosting. Michael was downstairs pouring himself a glass of water when
     Berlin introduced herself to him and complimented his plaid pajama pants.</p>
     <p>As days passed, Berlin reached out to Michael to see if he knew the whereabouts of a lost sweater her
     friend, Holly, had lost. The sweater was never seen again, but it gave Michael a good reason to ask for
     Berlin's number in case it ever came up. ;)</p>
